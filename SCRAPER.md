# Scraper

## Assignment

Write a Sinatra app that scrapes the contents of another site and presents the 
data as a REST web service. This could be stock quotes, baseball scores, a 
translation service, or anything else of comparable effort.

We realize this assignment is a bit ambiguous and open ended. That's intentional.
Please take some liberties with your interpretation, and make it fun. With all
that said, don't be afraid to ask questions.

Your solution should include a README file that documents usage of the service.
The README format is up to you.

## Submission

When you're comfortable with your code, push the code to Github and deploy the 
app somewhere we can reach it (Heroku is free). Send the URL to whomever you've 
been working with at EdgeCase, and we'll get back to you within a few days.

Be prepared to explain your code to us. We will offer constructive feedback.  
We're generally opinionated but nice people, so don't stress out. Please have 
fun with this project and give it your best effort. Cheers!

## Caveat

We don't expect you to spend more than a couple hours on this, and the short 
timeframe is taken into account during the review.  Please don't spend days 
working on a masterpiece.
